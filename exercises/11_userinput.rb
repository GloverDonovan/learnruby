print "How old are you? "
age = gets.chomp

print "How tall are you? "
height = gets.chomp

print "How much do you weigh? "
weight = gets.chomp

puts "So, you're #{age} old, #{height} tall, and weigh #{weight} heavy." # personally wouldn't say "weigh ____ heavy", but it's part of the lesson

# oh, and wow, this works.

# Note to self: what is the gets object? The chomp method?


# Also lecture note: use PRINT before asking for input if you don't want a new line from puts.
