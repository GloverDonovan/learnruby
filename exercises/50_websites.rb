# SINATRA YESSSSS

# "Before you attempt this exercise you must have completed
# Exercise 46 successfully and have a working gem installed
# such that you can install packages and know how to make a
# skeleton project directory."

# I wonder if this will work

require "sinatra"
get "/hi" do
	"Hello World"
end

# Actually, no clue how to make it work in Codio. Skipping for now.
