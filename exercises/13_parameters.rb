first, second, third = ARGV # what could this possibly do?

puts "Your first variable is: #{first}"
puts "Your second variable is: #{second}"
puts "Your third variable is #{third}"

# Oh wow! It uses the parameters AFTER the file to determine what to run inside of the program. This could be very useful!
# Example: ruby 13_parameters.rb myFirstVariableText mySecondVariableText myThirdVariableText
