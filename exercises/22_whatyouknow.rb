# What YOU know so far:
# puts <string> -> prints a string WITH a new line feed
# variableName = <stuff> -> define a variable
# "my String #{myExpression}" -> write expressions inside strings, particularly variable names
# myFormatter = "%{somePassedVariable} and ${anotherVariable" THEN
# puts myFormatter % {somePassedVariable: "somestring", etc.} -> used to create string patterns
# Triple """double quotes""" for multi-line strings.
# print <string> -> prints a string WITHOUT a new line feed
# gets.chomp -> prompts the user for a string, then remove the ending return character with .chomp
# $stdin.gets.chomp -> a more formal version of gets.chomp
# <variable, anotherVariable, thirdVar> = ARGV -> use the given parameters from the command line OR
# <variableName> = ARGV.first -> set variableName as the first given parameter
# You can also "puts" multiple lines by using commas between the phrases:
# puts "this is my awesome string", "that has a second line"
